This project was part of my C++ Programming module in my final year of college

## Overview

This project involved a lot of algorithmic thinking to produce a Digital Rain effect that could also be seen in the movie [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix).

- **Vectors:** Utilizing vectors for storing and manipulating the raindrop position and speed.
- **Algorithms:** Essential for generating the random characters and controlling the positing and flow of the rain.
- **Iterators:** Used to efficiently pass through the vector and update the state of each droplet.
